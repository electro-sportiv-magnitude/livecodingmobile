this is a project to play around with rampbeat/bytebeat functions on your phone

its based on a PureData patch idea recieved by a youtube video of gabo vinazza

you need to install MobMuPlat on your phone to run this patch

it combines several GUI play arounds with livecoding in expr~ boxes and includes two samplers with six preset sounds;
further documentation needs to be done;
this is very experimental in the design and the patch idea;
check out some bytebeat formulas ;
any questions just get in touch IG:@planet._.safe;
